# Advantages of cloud:
> + **Pay as you go:**

Pay-as-you-go cloud computing (PAYG cloud computing) is a payment method for cloud computing that charges based on usage.

Before some time you had to take the servers on a lease. It takes time to physically transfer the servers.And also for that u have to maintain a temperature , security as well as the electricity , etc . so the cloud had removed all these things totally.
In this,you dont have need to pay for the upfront like security deposit and all. Just go use the resources if u want u can increase the resources.

Administration work is get handled by the aws.
How to maintain the tempertaure ,electricity all these things are get handled by the aws.


> + **Increased Reliablitiy:**

It Means our cloud becomes the trustworthy. It gives 99.99999% surity to provide the resources .But in some cases like the natural disasters , their data center is get affected then to save theirselves, they dont give the 0.0001% guarranty.

> + **Control on the Documents:**

Before cloud came into being, workers needed to send files in and out as the email attachments for being worked on by a single user at one time ultimately ending up with a mess of contrary titles, formats, and file content. Moving to cloud computing has facilitated central file storage.

> + **Easily Manageable:**

Cloud computing offers simplified and enhanced IT maintenance and management capacities by agreements backed by SLA, central resource administration and managed infrastructure. You get to enjoy a basic user interface without any requirement for installation. Plus you are assured guaranteed and timely management, maintenance, and delivery of the IT services.
