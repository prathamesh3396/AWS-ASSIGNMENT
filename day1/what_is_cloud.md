# What is cloud?
The cloud refers to:

Servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers.
Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world.
By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.
## Different Types of Cloud
# Private cloud:
It is owned by one organization.
A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by one business or organisation.
The private cloud can be physically located at your organisation’s on-site datacenter or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.
### Advantages of a private clouds:

> + More Flexibility-Your organisation can customise its cloud environment to meet specific business needs.

> + Improved security—Resources are not shared with others, so higher levels of control and security are possible.

> + High scalability—Private clouds still afford the scalability and efficiency of a public cloud.

# Public cloud:
Anyone can use it.
The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the Internet.
Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud.
### Advantages of a public cloud:

> + Lower costs—No need to purchase hardware or software and you pay only for the service you use.

> + No maintenance—Your service provider provides the maintenance.

> + Near-unlimited scalability—on-demand resources are available to meet your business needs.

> + High reliability—a vast network of servers ensures against failure.

# Hybrid Cloud:
It is the combinaion of private and public cloud.
Hybrid clouds combine on-premises infrastructure, or private clouds, with public clouds so organisations can reap the advantages of both.
### Advantages of a Hybrid cloud:

> + Control—Your organisation can maintain a private infrastructure for sensitive assets.

> + Flexibility—you can take advantage of additional resources in the public cloud when you need them.

> + Cost-effectiveness—with the ability to scale to the public cloud, you pay for extra computing power only when needed.
